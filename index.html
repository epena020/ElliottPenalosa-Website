        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Elliott Penalosa and I am a 4th Year at the Univerisity of California, Riverside. I am a Biochemistry major with an emphasis in Medical Sciences. My current career goal is to become a dentist and serve my community in Rancho Cucamonga by helping people restore confidence in themselves through their smiles.<br><br>

        I was born and raised in Southern California. I spent most of my youth around Rancho Cucamonga and currently live in Riverside, California. My hobbies include playing video games, building custom computers, and building custom keyboards. I am also trying to get into cooking and crochet as some more hobbies on the side. All of my hobbies focus on manual dexterity because I am a hands-on learner. I enjoy taking things apart and building them back together to see how each part plays a role in the final product. Inside of Custom Computer building, each component plays an important role in the overall speed and processing power of the computer. Keyboard building is much more of a niche hobby that focuses on the feeling and the acoustics of the keyboard. The materials of each component as well as different types of lubricants for the keyboard switches and stabilizes drastically affect the final product.<br><br>
        
        I am currently a member of the COPE Health Scholars over at Kaiser Permanente Riverside. I have been in that program since February 2019 and have accumulated around 800 hours. I have shifted in multiple departments including Medical Telemetry, Physical Medicine, Pediatrics, Urgent Care, the Emergency Department, Employee Health, and Care Navigators of Pediatrics. Each of these departments has given me insight into the different departments throughout the hospital and how each has different specialties in the overall patient care experience. I also held leadership positions throughout my time in the COPE Health Scholars program including Department Coordinator of Urgent Care, as well as the Assistant Director of Departments. As the Department Coordinator of Urgent Care, I was in charge of overseeing about 20 students per rotation. I ensured that each student had the appropriate number of shifts scheduled, calendars were updated, and that the overall COPE Health Scholar experience in the Urgent Care department was as smooth as possible. I was later invited by my program manager to become an Assistant Director of Departments which oversaw Urgent Care, Medical Telemetry, Radiology, Physical Medicine, the Emergency Department, and Pediatrics. As the Assistant Director of Departments, I oversaw the Department Coordinators of each of those departments and ensured that all of their duties were being completed, while also enforcing disciplinary action on any student who violates policy. Aside from the COPE Health Scholars program, I am also the office manager over at Oasis Dental in Rancho Cucamonga. I originally shadowed Dr. Johnson in order to get some experience in a Dental office and eventually got hired as an assistant office manager. I was then promoted to the office manager and currently assist with payroll, insurance verification, as well as front desk clerical tasks. Some of my biggest achievements are incorporating ADP for payroll and retirement guidance as well as Eassist to assist with insurance billing.
